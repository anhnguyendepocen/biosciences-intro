# Installing the R notebook system

To use the Notebook, you will need R and R Studio, and the R Studio Notebook
packages installed on the computer you are working on.  These are all
completely free (no cost and open-source).   There are a couple of videos on
how to install these on:

* [Windows](https://vimeo.com/239492022) but \- don't install the 3.4.2 R version, that
  was the most recent at the time of the video, install the latest version \-
  3.6.1 at time of writing.
* [macOS / OS X](https://vimeo.com/239497938) but \- don't install the 3.4.0 R version,
  that was the most recent at the time of the video, install the latest version
  \- 3.6.1 at time of writing.

If you're on Linux, we're pretty sure you can work it out for yourself.

Some people have had problems when trying to create new R Notebooks, with an
error message that "One or more packages required for R Notebook creation were
not installed".  If you get this error, try the fix at
