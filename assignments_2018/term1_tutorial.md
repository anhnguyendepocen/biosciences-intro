# Autumn term reading

Follow this tutorial - [R from
scratch](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/r-from-scratch). It covers the
material that you need for this assignment.   You will need to make a free
DataCamp account to do the tutorial, but **the R from scratch course is
completely free** (see below).

Some people have had trouble viewing the two short videos in the course. If
so, first try reloading the browser page, and if that fails, here are direct
links. The videos are less than 5% of the whole course:

-   [Introduction video](https://vimeo.com/298409140)
-   [Video on variables](https://vimeo.com/298409140)

At various points, DataCamp will put up splash screen asking you to \"Upgrade
your account to continue\" with \"Full access to all courses\". Just press
Escape (the Esc key) to continue without upgrade.  You do not need to upgrade
to do this course.
