# General introduction

This year we introduce you to the R statistical computing language.
R is very powerful environment and language for statistics and data
analysis.  It is widely used in Bioscience research, and being able to
use R is a skill that many employers will value, in Biosciences and
beyond.  R is very different from Excel - instead of clicking around an
interface, you do an R analysis by typing commands for R to execute.
This takes some getting used to, but it has several major advantages:

*  It is much easier to record what you did in your analysis in a way that you
   can check and repeat;  this makes it easier to avoid and to spot mistakes
   (see [Economists, an Excel error, and the misguided push for austerity](https://theconversation.com/economists-an-excel-error-and-the-misguided-push-for-austerity-13584)
   for one particularly scary example);
*  the underlying language gives you great power to adapt and extend
   your analysis;
*  you are using the same tools as other bioscience and statistics and
   data science researchers, so it is easier to collaborate with them,
   and ask for advice;
*  for the same reason there is lots of help and support for using R
   online.

## Installing R Studio and the R Notebook

To use the Notebook, you will need R and R Studio, and the R Studio Notebook
packages installed on the computer you are working on.  These are all
completely free (no cost and open-source).   There are a couple of videos on
how to install these on:

* [Windows](https://vimeo.com/239492022) but \- don't install the 3.4.2 R version, that
  was the most recent at the time of the video, install the latest version \-
  3.5.1 at time of writing.
* [macOS / OS X](https://vimeo.com/239497938) but \- don't install the 3.4.0 R version,
  that was the most recent at the time of the video, install the latest version
  \- 3.5.1 at time of writing.

If you're on Linux, we're pretty sure you can work it out for yourself.

Some people have had problems when trying to create new R Notebooks, with an
error message that "One or more packages required for R Notebook creation were
not installed".  If you get this error, try the fix at
