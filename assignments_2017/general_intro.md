# General introduction

Last year we introduced you to some basic statistical ideas, such as
means, standard deviations, standard errors, regression, correlation,
chi-squared and t-tests.  If you are unsure about any of these concepts,
please go back to the Canvas modules in BIO145 & BIO152  and refresh
your memory before tackling these questions.

This year we introduce you to the R statistical computing language.
R is very powerful environment and language for statistics and data
analysis.  It is widely used in Bioscience research, and being able to
use R is a skill that many employers will value, in Biosciences and
beyond.  R is very different from Excel - instead of clicking around an
interface, you do an R analysis by typing commands for R to execute.
This takes some getting used to, but it has several major advantages:

*  it is much easier to record what you did in your analysis in a way
   that you can check and repeat;  this makes it easier to avoid and to
   spot mistakes (see [The Excel Error that Changed
   History](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-18/faq-reinhart-rogoff-and-the-excel-error-that-changed-history)
   for one particularly scary example);
*  the underlying language gives you great power to adapt and extend
   your analysis;
*  you are using the same tools as other bioscience and statistics and
   data science researchers, so it is easier to collaborate with them,
   and ask for advice;
*  for the same reason there is lots of help and support for using R
   online.

This module introduces you to the R way of doing things.

There are two tests for this module one in each of semester 1 and
semester 2. Each is a pass / fail test, where 70/100 is the pass mark.
Each counts for \2.5% of the whole course mark.

Start the work for this semester, by going to http://tryr.codeschool.com. Go
through the 8 short chapters there; they introduce you to the R language and
how to use it.  You will need this introduction for the first test (semester
1).  This is an R Notebook assignment.  See the question for more details.

To use the Notebook, you will need R and R Studio, and the R Studio Notebook
packages installed on the computer you are working on.  These are all
completely free (no cost and open-source).   There are a couple of videos on
how to install these on:

* [Windows](https://vimeo.com/239492022)
* [macOS / OS X](https://vimeo.com/239497938)

If you're on Linux, we're pretty sure you can work it out for yourself.

Some people have had problems when trying to create new R Notebooks, with an
error message that "One or more packages required for R Notebook creation were
not installed".  If you get this error, try the fix at

Any remaining problems with installation, please mail \<your email here\> for
help.
