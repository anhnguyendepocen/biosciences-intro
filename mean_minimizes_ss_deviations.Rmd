The mean $\frac{1}{N} \sum x_i$ is the value $\mu$ such that the sum of squared deviations $S$ is miminized.  Thus $S = \sum (x_i - \mu)^2$.


The general procedure is to differentiate $\sum (x_i - \mu)^2$ with respect to $\mu$, and find where this derivative is 0, to get the minimum.   We find the minimum is where $\mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum x_i$

```{python}
# Sympy is Python's symbolic mathematics library.
from sympy import (symbols, summation, diff, IndexedBase, Add, Eq,
                   simplify, expand, solve)
# Render Sympy equations nicely in the notebook
from sympy.interactive import printing
printing.init_printing()
```

Build the equation for the sum of squared deviations.

```{python}
# Symbols
i, n = symbols('i, n', integer=True, positive=True)
mu = symbols('mu')
# The vector of observations
x = IndexedBase('x')
```

```{python}
ss = summation((x[i] - mu)**2, (i, 1, n))
ss
```

Expand:

```{python}
ess = expand(ss)
ess
```

Simplify the terms:

```{python}
simple_ess = Add(*[simplify(term).doit() for term in ess.args])
simple_ess
```

Differentiate this equation with respect to $\mu$:

```{python}
d = diff(simple_ess, mu)
d
```

We find the minimum by setting equal to 0, and solving for $\mu$. 

```{python}
# Set derivative to 0
to_solve = Eq(d, 0)
to_solve
```

Solve for $\mu$, and we get the formula for the mean:

```{python}
solve(to_solve, mu)
```
